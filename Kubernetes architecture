1. Master Node (Control Plane):

API Server: The central hub that receives all commands (REST requests); itâ€™s how you interact with Kubernetes.
Scheduler: Decides which worker node should run your new application (pod).
Controller Manager: Keeps track of things like failed nodes, scaling, and replication.
etcd: A key-value store that saves all cluster data (configuration and state).
2. Worker Nodes:

Kubelet: Makes sure containers are running as they should on its node; talks to the master.
Container Runtime: Software (like Docker) that actually runs your containers.
Kube Proxy: Handles networking, enabling communication inside and outside the cluster.
3. Pods:
The smallest unit in Kubernetes, usually running one or more containers.

How It Works Together:
The master node manages the cluster, scheduling applications (pods) onto worker nodes.
Worker nodes run your apps, keep them healthy, and handle networking.
